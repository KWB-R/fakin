>"Know where and why people get lost in your content. Tree testing is a 
usability technique for evaluating the findability of topics 
in a website. It’s also known as ‘reverse card sorting’ or ‘card-based 
classification’. Tree testing is done on a simplified text version of your 
site structure – without the influence of navigation aids and visual design.
Take the guesswork out of information architecture with Treejack – the usability 
testing tool you can use to test your IA without visual distractions. Treejack 
helps you prove your site structure will work before you get into interface 
design."
