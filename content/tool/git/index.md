"Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to 
handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. 
It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with 
features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple 
workflows." [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
