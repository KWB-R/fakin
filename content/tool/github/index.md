>"GitHub Inc. is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is 
mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control 
and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as 
bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. 
GitHub offers plans for enterprise, team, pro and free accounts which are 
commonly used to host open-source software projects. From January 2019, GitHub 
now offers unlimited private repositories to all plans, including free accounts."
