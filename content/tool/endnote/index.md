[EndNote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EndNote) is currently the standard software at KWB for managing literature references. 

An open-source alternative for the future could be [Zotero](../zotero/), which offers additional features like cloud-storage or automated access through [API](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/web_api/v3/start) (e.g. the R package 
[RefManageR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RefManageR/) is able to connect to a [Zotero](https://zotero.org) database using the function [ReadZotero()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/RefManageR/versions/1.2.0/topics/ReadZotero).


For a full comparison of the features of different reference management software available see [Wikipedia, 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software).
