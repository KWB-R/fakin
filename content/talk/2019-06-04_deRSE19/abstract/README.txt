The RMarkdown document "knowledge-repo.Rmd" with the abstract is created by 
based on the template "default-1.17.0.2.tex" (i.e. the standard Rmarkdown template 
used!) and creates the abstract "knowledge-repo.pdf" in R(Studio) with the help 
of the R packages "rmarkdown" and "RefManageR" (for importing the references 
stored in "references.bib")

In addtion a "source_code.zip" zip file (using the R package "zip") is created 
automatically when the RMarkdown document is created containing all required 
files for reproducing this abstract.
