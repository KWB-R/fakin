# R Package for the Quantification of Technical Resilience

[kwb.resilience](https://github.com/KWB-R/kwb.resilience) allows calculating different resilience indices for time series. Equations are described and discussed in the freely available conference paper by [Matzinger et al. (2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326040304_Quantitative_Beschreibung_der_Resilienz_urbaner_Wassersysteme) (unfortunately in German only). The sample data for the first example in the paper is also contained in the package as a data.frame “oxygen”.

The package should make a starting point for a broader discussion of approaches to tackle resilience of urban water infrastructure for applied cases. Accordingly, adaptations and suggestions are encouraged!
