# Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) for water supply systems

For performing quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) the open-source 
R package [kwb.qmra](https://github.com/KWB-R/kwb.qmra) was developed at KWB 
within the [DEMOWARE]() project and is extended and tested within the [AquaNES]() project
