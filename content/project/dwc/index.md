### Challenges and Solutions  

**How to best collect budgets from multiple project partners during the proposal phase?**

An EXCEL template was developed by [Hauke Sonnenberg](../../authors/sonnenberg/),
which can be automatically imported into [R](../../tool/r/) for data aggregation 
and analysis. 

**How to write a data management plan**

[Christoph Sprenger](../../authors/sprenger/) used the online service [DMPonline](../../tool/dmponline/) for creating a data management plan for a 
task (make groundwater visible) within the DWC project.
